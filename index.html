          Hello. My name is Kevin Chang and I teach data structures at UC Berkeley.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is my personal website, currently a work in progress.
          Originally this was supposed to be a site for learning CS61B material
          as well, but I've long since realized there are plenty of thoroughly fleshed
          out resources out there. Until I decide what to do, enjoy my low-effort
          Web Design DeCal final project.
        </p>
        
        <!-- <h1>About You</h1> -->
        <!-- <p> -->
        <!--   If you are reading this, you are likely one of my students -->
        <!--   currently taking said course. -->
        <!--   It is my hope that this site may be helpful for you -->
        <!--   as a supplement in comprehending the material we cover -->
        <!--   throughout the semester. -->
        <!-- </p> -->

        <!-- <h1>About Me</h1> -->
        <!-- <p> -->
        <!--   I'm from the town of Simi Valley, about 30 minutes away from Los Angeles, -->
        <!--   and am a rising 4th year studying EECS. -->
        <!-- </p> -->
        <!-- <p> -->
        <!--   In my free time, I enjoy sleeping, cooking, -->
        <!--   or playing the guitar. -->
        <!-- </p> -->
        <!-- <p> -->
        <!--   I find philosophy and poetry to be interesting, although -->
        <!--   one should be aware that I am not well versed in either. -->
        <!-- </p> -->
        <!-- <p> -->
        <!--   Finally, -->
        <!--   <\!--I am a slow learner, and any knowledge I have regarding -->
        <!--       computer science or any subject is merely the result of me being exposed -->
        <!--       to it long enough that it would be impossible for me to not learn -->
        <!--       a thing or two.-\-> -->
        <!--   I hold no pretensions of being an expert in the subject of -->
        <!--   data structures, and hope you will forgive any errors I make -->
        <!--   in attempting to teach it. -->
        <!-- </p> -->
