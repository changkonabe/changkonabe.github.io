        <p>
          Java is a language that in which its programs are compiled.
          This differs from Python, which is implemented
          mainly through interpretation.
          As you may have seen with Python in CS61A, interpretted means the
          program is executed line by line as it is run. What it means to be compiled
          is that a software known as a compiler takes code and translates it to
          another language, usually one at a lower level and closer to machine language.
          It is this compiled code that is then run in order to run the program.

        <h2>Java Syntax</h2>
        <p>
          The syntax for logical operators consist of:
        </p>
        <code>&&, ||, !</code>
        <p>
          Which represent logical AND, OR, and NOT respectively.
