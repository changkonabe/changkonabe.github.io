        <h1>An Intro to Java.</h1>
        <div id="read-time"></div>
        <p>
          Java is a language in which its programs are compiled.
          This differs from Python, which is implemented
          mainly through interpretation.
          As you may have seen with Python in CS61A, interpreted means the
          program is executed line by line as it is run. What it means to be compiled
          is that a software known as a compiler takes code and translates it to
          another language, usually one at a lower level and closer to machine language.
          It is this compiled code that is then executed in order to run the program.
        </p>
        <h2>Primitives and Typing</h2>
        <p>
          In Java, there are 8 primitive types, which are basic data types implemented
          and supported by the language. They are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 40px;">
          <li>boolean: true or false.</li>
          <li>char: 16-bit Unicode character such as 'a'.</li>
          <li>byte: 8-bit two's complement integer.</li>
          <li>short: 16-bit two's complement integer.</li>
          <li>int: 32-bit two's complement integer.</li>
          <li>long: 64-bit two's complement integer.</li>
          <li>float: single precision 32-bit floating point.</li>
          <li>double: double precision 64-bit floating point.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Java as a language is statically typed. This means all declaration
          of variables specifies the type of the variable in that scope.
          So, if we want to declare a variable to store primitive ints, we could
          have a declaration like:
        </p>
        <code>int x;</code><br>
        <code>x = 5;</code>
        <p>
          Note that then the line
        </p>
        <code>x = true;</code>
        <p>
          would cause the
          program to fail at compilation because we see the variable x
          in this scope is already of static type "int", so it is not
          possible to redeclare its value to be something of type boolean.
        </p>
        <h2>Logical Operators</h2>
        <p>
          To represent logical AND, OR, and NOT respectively, we have
        </p>
        <code>
          &&, ||, !
        </code>
